## Tracks
* CYBROSX - Where X stands for Research, Development and Programming
* IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) - IEEE's core purpose is to foster technological innovation and excellence     for the benefit of humanity. The Student branch activities offer numerous educational, technical and professional opportunities         through various events, talks and workshops to enhance the skill set of students.
* Innovation Club and Incubation Center - Innovation Club is envisaged to network people, ideas, experiences & resources to galvanize     the innovation community in LNMIIT. This club not only helps to nurture your ideas and encourage you to bring up business proposals.     And there is also an Incubation centre where in after rigorous evaluation of your idea the institute will provide you with the           required facilities and perhaps you can even get funds for your project.

IEEE has thus, taken a step forth to help promote all the women across the globe with IEEE Women In         Engineering.
* Women Who Code Delhi - They envision a world where women are proportionally represented as technical leaders, executives, founders,     VCs, board members, and software engineers.
